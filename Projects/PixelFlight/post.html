        Flight was a project which I basically did just out of curiosity.
        All I wanted to do was to publish a finished game on the Play Store, which I did.
        Granted it is really nothing special but I am still proud to be able to say that you can download one of my games.
        All you do in this little pixel game is to dodge asteroids, which fly at you at ever faster speeds.
        The controls are very simple and you can't even unlock anything.
        It's really all about the highscore.

        I finished the core game in less than a day and it took about 2 more days to get it ready to be published.
        In total I think I spent about 5 hours coding.
        Most of the time went into figuring out how to publish a game and what you need for that.
        Creating the screenshots and and texts for the Play Store was also a new task for me.
        In the end it only received about 20 downloads of course.
        I didn't market it at all so I didn't expect much of it anyway.
        But I updated it once which was also very interesting to see how that works.
