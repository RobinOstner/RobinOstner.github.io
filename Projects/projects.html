            This is a game, which is still being made.
          It is for the "Icehouse Jam" on <a href="https://www.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with the main topic being "Myths and Legends".
          The secondary topic is "Far away and lost".
          We started on the 8. November and have to be finished on the 30. September, which gives us around 3 weeks of development.
          Our team consists of 2 programmers and 1 audio designer.
          On this project I decided to create the art for it as well, so I acted as a coder and an artist.

            Tomorrow is a game, which I have been making every now and then for about a year now.
            Since I was busy with getting my university finished and writing my bachelor's thesis I didn't make as much progress as I wish I could.
            It is very far from finished but I still think it is worth sharing.
            Maybe it won't ever get finished so why not share what I have so far.

            Why are some games more fun than others?
            A very common answer to this question is that some games have better gameplay.
            It is true that at the base of every good game is good gameplay, but gameplay is not something completely independent of all the other things in a videogame.
            For example, would Super Mario 64 still be so much fun, if instead of controlling Mario with all his animations and sound effects, you would control a rectangular box?

          <p class="content">
            This game was created for the 2018 Winter Semester Game Jam at the Technical University of Munich.
            It was a 48-Hour Jam, which forces you to work very fast.
            The topic of the gamejam was "Discovery" which was something very different to the usual topics.
            We decided to create a game where you play as a shepherd who has to discover/find the wolf amongst the sheep.

            Flight was a project which I basically did just out of curiosity.
            All I wanted to do was to publish a finished game on the app store, which I did.
            Granted it is really nothing special but I am still proud to be able to say that you can download one of my games.
            All you do in this little pixel game is to dodge asteroids, which fly at you at ever faster speeds.
            The controls are very simple and you can't even unlock anything.
            It's really all about the highscore.

            Half-Byte 3 the long awaited sequel by.. No wait! This is the wrong one.
            Ah yes we really did make a joke about Half Life, but only because we couldn't think of a name and we needed one.
            So as you can tell there obviously is no Half-Byte and also no Half-Byte 2. It's just Half-Byte 3.
