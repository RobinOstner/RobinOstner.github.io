            This is a game, which is still being made.
          It is for the "Icehouse Jam" on <a href="https://www.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with the main topic being "Myths and Legends".
          The secondary topic is "Far away and lost".
          We started on the 8. November and have to be finished on the 30. September, which gives us around 3 weeks of development.
          Our team consists of 2 programmers and 1 audio designer.
          On this project I decided to create the art for it as well, so I acted as a coder and an artist.

            Tomorrow is a game, which I have been making every now and then for about a year now.
            Since I was busy with getting my university finished and writing my bachelor's thesis I didn't make as much progress as I wish could.
            It is very far from finished but I still think it is worth sharing.
            Maybe it won't ever get finished so why not share what I have so far.
