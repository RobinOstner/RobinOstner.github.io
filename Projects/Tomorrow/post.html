        Tomorrow is a game, which I have been making every now and then for about a year now.
        Since I was busy with getting my university finished and writing my bachelor's thesis I didn't make as much progress as I wish I could.
        It is very far from finished but I still think it is worth sharing.
        Maybe it won't ever get finished so why not share what I have so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea for the game came from a dinner with a friend of mine, who is part of this project ever since.
        We call ourselves "Aliens From Earth" and you can find more about this game on our instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wearealiensfromearth" target="_blank">@wearealiensfromearth</a>.
        I wanted to make a game and he wanted to make music and sounds for a game.
        The basic idea was to create a simple 2D-Platformer, where you play as a mech, which is lost in an old nuclear reactor called "The Arch".
        It plays in the future, where the apocalypse has started, because god was not happy with the human dependence on machines.
        The mech is there to hide and to repair himself, because he has been fighting off the demons, which were sent by god.
        He is very weak at the beginning of the game and doesn't even have a weapon.
        All he can do is hide.
        Over time he can assemble some new weapons, which could give him an advantage over the many creatures which roam the Arch.
        On top of the demons there are the robots from the Arch, which were created to defend the reactor from any intruders.

        The mech is one day going to have the ability to climb walls, fire different weapons, hide in grass and repel from ropes.
        So far I have only implemented a rather basic controller, which allows the player to walk, run, jump, slide on the walls and fire a simple machine gun.
        Gameplay wise we still haven't got a lot, which is worth showing, since everyone has seen a character jump around on the screen.
        I still want to share some of the results so far.

      <p>
        As I said in the beginning I don't have a lot to share at this moment in time but I will probably be working on this for a long time to come.
        Maybe one day it will be a complete game but maybe not.
        In the meantime I am just having fun creating it and learning.
