          This is a game, which is still being made.
          It is for the "Icehouse Jam" on <a href="https://www.itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with the main topic being "Myths and Legends".
          The secondary topic is "Far away and lost".
          We started on the 8. November and have to be finished on the 30. September, which gives us around 3 weeks of development.
          Our team consists of 2 programmers and 1 audio designer.
          On this project I decided to create the art for it as well, so I acted as a coder and an artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing that came to our mind when we heard "Myths and Legends" were of course the real world legends of old, one of them being the norse mythology.
          We sat together and started brainstorming and we quickly had the idea of creating a 2D-Platformer where you get lost in the world and have to find the boss.
          Getting lost is achieved by having multiple layers of the world, which the player seemlessly travels through.
          This means that you could be at the same X & Y Position of the world but find yourself in a completely different place.
          So far we haven't really tested it but the technical side of things already works flawlessly.
          The boss fight is supposed to be a huge troll, which lives on the top of a mountain.

          This already gets us to the setting and style of the game.
          Since the game is meant to be set around the norse mythology we decided to put our world on a snowy mountain, with sheer cliffs and big rocks everywhere.
          This adds to the impression of being lost and somewhere far away.
          We originally set out to create a game which looks a little bit like concept art or watercolors, but since we don't have a proper artist this was very hard or even impossible to achieve.
          The result still looks quite nice I think. To get to this I first started to draw some sketches of possible characters and then refining the design once we settled for one.

      <p>
        After this was done we started creating a playable prototype including the movement through the world and a first draft of the boss fight.
        The movement was rather easy to get down, since I have done many small platformer games in my own time, but this time I decided to handle all of the physics myself, which gave us more control over the movement.
        One of the harder things is getting the boss fight to work, since we all have never done anything like it.
        The design of the boss looks like this:

      At the moment this is all I can share but I'll make sure to update it once the game is done.
      Here is a screenshot of the game in its current state:
