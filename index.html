            Hi, my name is Robin and I'm a 23 year old game creator & programmer.
            Originally I wanted to study Media Design, but after I got rejected I quickly realized that I'm not that great of an artist.
            I then remembered that I always loved games and was always interested in how they are created, because to me it seemed like it was magic.
            So I started to study Games Engineering at the Technical University of Munich and quickly fell in love with the art of programming and creating games.
            Ever since then I have been making games whenever I could, be it for university projects, gamejams or private projects just for fun.
            Last year I finally graduated and am now looking to make my way into the gaming world.
            My bachelor's thesis was about "Applying Methods of Game Feel" where I created a small platformer.
            The game was built in a way, which allowed me to modify certain parameters and to test the impact on the feel of the game.
            What is the feel of a game? That's a good question, but not an easy one to answer.
            All I can say here is that it is one of the most important aspects of the moment to moment action in a videogame, which is why I was so interested to write about it.
            You can find the whole thesis <a class="download" href="Bachelorarbeit-RobinOstner.pdf" target ="_blank">here</a>.

          <p class="sectionParagraph">
            This is my portfolio where I showcase a small selection of the things I have done so far.
            It is the result of studying Games Engineering at the Technical University of Munich for 4 years.
            Since we had some small projects I will feature them here as well, but the focus is on the projects which I have completed outside of university.
            Some of them never really got finished but I still think that they are worth sharing.
            The biggest and most complete projects are probably the games which have been created duringÂ 48-hour gamejams in the last years and my bachelor thesis.
            All three of the gamejam games have received some very nice feedback and were awarded as one of the top five games (out of 30 or so).
            Two even won first place, which I am still very proud of to this day.
            Of course those games were not created by me alone and so are many of my other projects, as I enjoy working with other creatives.
            For my bachelor thesis I got some amazing feedback as well, with many people telling me that it is a fresh new take on games.
            In the beginning though, I was confronted with a lot of scepticism, because I basically told professors who spend their whole day thinking about games that they had missed a pretty significant piece of the puzzle.
            This meant that I really had to prove my point. Apparently I succeeded in this quest and it was graded with a 1.3 overall, which I am insanely happy with.
